This folder contains all the processes performed on original data in the "CrimeData_Year_Original" folder, including data cleaning, 
data management, etc. You can find all the details of every year's cleaning process from the "Rmd" file or "HTML" based on your preference. 
Since every year may have different problems with the NA values due to the policy changes of some crime types, or changes in state data reporting. 
If you want to have further understood why we choose the "estimated data" and replace some NA values with "actual data", please check the details in this folder. 

We believe through the logical process of data cleaning, the data for visualization and report to provide information are reliable. 
Customers can convince our results.

Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or comment on this folder.
