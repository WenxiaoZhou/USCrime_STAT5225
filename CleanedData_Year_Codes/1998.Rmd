> __Footnotes__  
1. Although arson data were included in the trend and clearance tables, sufficient data are not available to estimate totals for this offense.    
2. Violent crimes are offenses of murder, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault.  
3. Property crimes are offenses of burglary, larceny-theft, and motor vehicle theft. Data are not included for the property crime of arson.  
4. Forcible rape figures furnished by the state-level Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program administered by the Delaware State Bureau of Investigation were not in accordance with national UCR guidelines.  The 1998 UCR forcible rape totals for Delaware were estimated from the state’s reported 1998 total.  Therefore, only the state total is shown.  See Offense Estimation, Appendix I, for details.  
5. Includes offenses reported by the Zoological Police.  
6. Complete data for 1998 were not available for the states of Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Montana, New Hampshire, and Wisconsin; therefore, it was necessary that their crime counts be estimated.  See Offense Estimation, Appendix I, for details.   
7. The 1998 Bureau of the Census population estimate for Puerto Rico was not available prior to publication; therefore, no population or rates per 100,000 inhabitants are provided.  
8. Data are not comparable to previous years’ data due to changes in reporting practices.
Offense totals are based on all reporting agencies and estimates for unreported areas.  

		
```{r}
names(fbi1998)  <- c("index", "Population", "CrimeIndex",
                     "ViolentCrimeLegacy", "PropertyCrime", 
                     "Murder", "RapeLegacy", "Robbery", "AggravatedAssault", 
                     "Burglary", "LarcenyTheft",	"MotorTheft")
```

We will clean the data column by column. 

# Tidy 
## Split `State` from index
```{r}
t <- fbi1998$index %>% str_remove_all("[^[:alpha:]]") %>% 
        str_detect("[:lower:]")
which(!t) %>% length # good 52

parse_index <- function(.index) {
        .index %>% str_remove_all("[^[:alpha:][:blank:]]") %>% 
        str_trim() %>% str_to_title()
}

fbi1998 <- fbi1998 %>% mutate(index = parse_index(index),
                              State = if_else(!t, index, NA_character_), 
                   .before = everything()) %>% 
        fill(State, .direction = "down")
  
```
Remove rows `!t == TRUE`.   
```{r}
fbi1998_1 <- fbi1998 %>% filter(t)
```


## Split `Area` from index  

1. Metropolitan Statistical Area
2. Cities Outside Metropolitan Areas  
3. Rural
4. State Total  

```{r}
fbi1998_2 <- fbi1998_1 %>% 
        mutate(index = case_when(
                index == "Metropolitan Statistical Area" ~ "Metropolitan Statistical Area",
                index == "Cities Outside Metropolitan Areas" ~ "Cities outside metropolitan areas", 
                index == "Area Actually Reporting" ~ "act",
                index == "Estimated Totals"   ~ "est",
                str_detect(index, "^Rate") ~ "est", 
                str_detect(index, "State([:blank:])+Total") ~ "State Total", 
                index == "Total" ~ "State Total",
                TRUE ~ index
        )) %>% 
        mutate(Area = case_when(
                index %in% c("Metropolitan Statistical Area", 
                             "Cities outside metropolitan areas",
                             "Rural", "State Total") ~ index, 
                TRUE ~ NA_character_
        ), .after = State) %>% 
        group_by(State) %>% 
        fill(Area, .direction = "down") %>% 
        mutate(index = if_else(index == Area, "popu", index)) %>% 
        ungroup
```

# Parsing  
## Parsing `ViolentCrimeLegacy` + `PropertyCrime` = `CrimeIndex`   
Add row id for parsing reference.

```{r}
parse_crime <- function(.col, .digits = 1) {
        if (is_character(.col)) {
                # "179, 294" will be parsed as 179
                # so that we have to remove blanks
                str_remove_all(.col, " ") %>% 
              parse_number() %>% round(.digits)
        } else return(.col %>% round(.digits))
}

fbi1998_3 <- fbi1998_2 %>% 
        rowid_to_column("id") %>% select(id, everything()) %>% 
        mutate(across(c(CrimeIndex:PropertyCrime), parse_crime)) %>% 
        mutate(diff_crime = ViolentCrimeLegacy + PropertyCrime - 
                 CrimeIndex, .after = CrimeIndex)


```   

```{r}
fbi1998_3 %>% 
        filter(!is.na(diff_crime), 
               !near(diff_crime, 0, tol = 0.11)) %>% # allow 0.1 rounding error
        print() %>% pull(id) -> t3
```

```{r}
fbi1998_3$diff_crime %>% na.omit() %>% near(0, tol = 0.11) %>% all
```


```{r}
fbi1998_3 <- fbi1998_3 %>% select(!c(CrimeIndex:diff_crime))
```



## Parsing `ViolentCrimeLegacy` = `Murder` + `RapeLegacy` + `Robbery` + `AggravatedAssault`
```{r}
fbi1998_4 <- fbi1998_3 %>% 
        mutate(across(c(Murder:AggravatedAssault), parse_crime)) %>% 
        mutate(diff_v = Murder + RapeLegacy + 
                 Robbery + AggravatedAssault - ViolentCrimeLegacy, 
               .after = ViolentCrimeLegacy)

fbi1998_4 %>% 
        filter(!is.na(diff_v), 
               !near(diff_v, 0, tol = 0.11)) %>% # allow 0.1 rounding error
        print() %>% pull(id) -> t4
```  
Well 1 rounding error... It's OK.

```{r}
fbi1998_4$diff_v %>% na.omit() %>% near(0, tol = 1.1) %>% all # good 
```


```{r}
fbi1998_4 <- fbi1998_4 %>% select(!diff_v)
```


## Parsing `PropertyCrime` = `Burglary` + `LarcenyTheft` + `MotorTheft`   
```{r}
fbi1998_5 <- fbi1998_4 %>% 
        mutate(across(c(Burglary:MotorTheft), parse_crime)) %>% 
        mutate(diff_p = Burglary + LarcenyTheft + MotorTheft -
                 PropertyCrime, 
               .after = PropertyCrime)

fbi1998_5 %>% 
        filter(!is.na(diff_p), 
               !near(diff_p, 0, tol = 0.11)) %>% # allow 0.1 rounding error
        print() %>% pull(id) -> t5
```

```{r}
fbi1998_5$diff_p %>% na.omit() %>% near(0, tol = 0.11) %>% all # good
```


```{r}
fbi1998_5 <- fbi1998_5 %>% select(!c(diff_p, id))
```


# Pivoting
## Prepare ID and pivoting index
First of all, we need to identify the ID that uniquely defines a row. In our datasets, ID = {State, Area}. The State column contains 52 different values: 50 states along with Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico. 
```{r}
fbi1998_5$State %>% unique %>% length # str_detect("PUERTO") %>% any

fbi1998_5 %>% 
        count(State, Area, index) %>% 
        filter(n > 1) # uniquely defines a row
```  

To match with data from 2005 to 2019, we rearrange the order of columns.  

```{r}
fbi1998_5 <- fbi1998_5 %>% 
        select(State:ViolentCrimeLegacy, Murder:AggravatedAssault, 
               PropertyCrime, Burglary:MotorTheft)
```

## Impute some NA's in act by zeros before pivoting  
Recall the footnote 4:  
> 4. Forcible rape figures furnished by the state-level Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program administered by the Delaware State Bureau of Investigation were not in accordance with national UCR guidelines.  The 1998 UCR forcible rape totals for Delaware were estimated from the state’s reported 1998 total.  Therefore, only the state total is shown.   

```{r}
fbi1998_5$index %>% unique # incorrect
fbi1998_5 %>% filter(index == "Area Actually Reporting Rural") 
fbi1998_5 %>% rowid_to_column() %>% 
        filter(State == "Rhode Island")

fbi1998_5$index[352] <- "act"
fbi1998_5$Area[353] <- "Rural"
fbi1998_5 <- fbi1998_5 %>% 
        add_row(State = "Rhode Island", Area = "Rural", 
                index = "popu", Population = "0", .after = 352)

fbi1998_5 %>% rowid_to_column() %>% 
        filter(State == "Rhode Island")
```  

```{r}
fbi1998_5 %>% rowid_to_column() %>% 
        filter(index == "act") %>% 
        filter(!complete.cases(.)) %>% print() %>% pull(rowid) -> t5
```


We have strong confidence to claim that except for Delaware, those NA's are actually zero, because the addition relationship among columns are preserved. 

```{r}
fbi1998_5 %>% rowid_to_column() %>% 
        filter(index == "act", State != "Delaware") %>% 
        filter(!complete.cases(.)) %>% print() %>% pull(rowid) -> t5

# Besides act, we need to impute those est such that the associated reporting rate != "1".
fbi1998_5 %>% rowid_to_column() %>% 
        slice(t5) %>% filter(parse_number(Population) != 1) %>% 
        print() %>% pull(rowid) %>% `+`(1) %>% c(t5) %>% sort() -> t5

fbi1998_5[t5, ] # good

fbi1998_5[t5, 5:13] <- fbi1998_5[t5, 5:13] %>% 
        replace(is.na(.), 0)

fbi1998_5 %>% rowid_to_column() %>% 
        filter(index == "act") %>% 
        filter(!complete.cases(.)) 
```  
Remember that Delaware is special.

## Pivot wider
```{r}
fbi1998_6 <- fbi1998_5 %>% 
        pivot_wider(names_from = index, values_from = Population:MotorTheft) 
```

```{r}
fbi1998_6 <- fbi1998_6 %>%
        rename(Population = Population_popu) %>%
        mutate(
                AreaActuallyReporting = round(as.numeric(Population_act), 3), # three digits
                .after = Area
        ) %>% select(
                -Population_est, 
                -Population_act,
                # we have renamed Population_popu, so simply drop all columns ending with "_popu"
                -ends_with("_popu")  
        )
# deal with "None" and NA is Population
# all "None" with two AreaActuallyReporting not NA 
fbi1998_6 %>% filter(is.na(Population) | str_to_upper(Population) == "NONE") %>% print(width = Inf)
```  
We do not want to impute NA in `Population` for Puerto Rico because of the footnote  

> 7. The 1998 Bureau of the Census population estimate for Puerto Rico was not available prior to publication; therefore, no population or rates per 100,000 inhabitants are provided.  

As a result, the `State Total` row of Puerto Rico should be deleted accordingly, because we cannot compute the `Rate of crime per 100,000 inhabitants`. But it's ok to treat `Population` in other rows of Puerto Rico as "0".

```{r}
popu_impute <- fbi1998_6 %>% rowid_to_column() %>% 
        filter(is.na(Population) | Population == "None", 
               AreaActuallyReporting == 1) %>% .[["rowid"]] 
popu_impute

fbi1998_6$Population[popu_impute] <- "0"

fbi1998_6 <- fbi1998_6 %>% 
        # Population contains "None"; remove those rows 
        # also, before pivoting, Population is a character because of the appearance of "None"
        filter(str_to_upper(Population) != "NONE") %>% # NA's are also dropped
        mutate(Population = parse_crime(Population, 0) %>% as.integer) 
```

## Impute NA in est
As mentioned before, there are implicit missing in the dataset. Pivoting wider makes it explicit and automatically replaces missing elements by NA's. However, before filling NA in est by corresponding act, we need to be very cautious. 
```{r}
fbi1998_6 %>% filter(Area != "State Total") %>% 
        map_dbl(~ sum(is.na(.x))) 
fbi1998_6 %>% filter(Area != "State Total") %>% 
        filter(is.na(ViolentCrimeLegacy_act), is.na(ViolentCrimeLegacy_est)) 
```

```{r}
fbi1998_6 %>% filter(Area != "State Total", State != "Delaware") %>% 
        select(AreaActuallyReporting, starts_with("Rape")) %>% 
        filter(is.na(RapeLegacy_est)) %>% 
        summarize(count_na_RapeLegacy_act = sum(is.na(RapeLegacy_act)), 
                  nrow = n(), 
                  Area_percent_1 = sum(AreaActuallyReporting == 1))
```
So we trace 40 missing in `est` to `AreaActuallyReporting` = 1. 

```{r}
fbi1998_6 %>% filter(Area != "State Total", State != "Delaware") %>% 
        map_dbl(~ sum(is.na(.x))) 
fbi1998_6 %>% filter(Area != "State Total", State == "Delaware") %>%
        map_dbl(~ sum(is.na(.x)))
```  


```{r}
fbi1998_6 %>% filter(AreaActuallyReporting %>% near(1)) %>% 
        select(ends_with("_est")) %>% 
        map_dbl(~ sum(is.na(.x)))
```
Hooray! 
```{r}
# Actually can be replaced by tidyr::complete() -> tidyr::fill() workflow before pivoting.
# But I have no idea how to expand the dataset. 
impute_est <- function(.tbl) {
        # To fill NA row-wise, we first have to obtain sub-tibbles
        #       that consist of all numeric columns.
